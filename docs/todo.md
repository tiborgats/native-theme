# native-theme: TODO

## Core API

### `SystemTheme` — expose layout metrics

- [ ] Add `pub layout: LayoutTheme` to `SystemTheme`. Approved 2026-08-10; see
      `docs/todo_v0.6.0_egui-connector-spec.md` §16 Q-2 and honesty-ledger item
      21. Today `from_preset` can supply `Spacing::item_spacing` and
      `Spacing::window_margin` but `from_system` cannot, because `SystemTheme`
      has no `layout` field — so the two spacing values a toolkit user reaches
      for first fall back to toolkit defaults on the system path.
      One additive field on a struct that already carries `preset` and
      `icon_theme`; no resolver work, since `Theme::layout` is a plain
      `LayoutTheme` shared across the light and dark variants and all four of
      its fields are `Option<f32>`, so an absent layout costs nothing.
      Benefits the egui, iced and gpui connectors equally.

## Toolkit Connectors

### native-theme-egui connector

- [ ] Implement the connector per `docs/todo_v0.6.0_egui-connector-spec.md`
      (rationale: `docs/todo_v0.6.0_egui-connector-rationale.md`). Targets
      egui 0.36.1.
- [ ] Add an MSRV CI job (spec §12.4, task 22). The workspace floor of `1.88.0`
      was measured on 2026-08-10, but nothing re-checks it: every CI job
      installs `@stable`, there is no `rust-toolchain.toml`, and
      `pre-release-check.sh` has no MSRV check. The job must cover the
      workspace at `1.88.0` and the egui connector separately at `1.95`.

### native-theme-gpui connector

- [ ] Map `WidgetMetrics` → gpui-component per-widget styling

#### Upstream PR to gpui

- [ ] PR: add `Window::screenshot()` API to gpui — gpui has no public way to
      capture the rendered framebuffer. The underlying blade-graphics backend
      has `copy_texture_to_buffer()` but gpui doesn't expose it. A public
      `screenshot()` method would enable headless CI screenshot capture on all
      platforms (like iced's `--screenshot` flag). Without this, gpui showcase
      screenshots are Linux-only (via external spectacle capture).

#### Upstream PRs to gpui-component

Where the connector needs customization hooks that gpui-component doesn't
expose, submit PRs to gpui-component upstream. Guidelines for acceptance:

- **Frame as "more theming flexibility"** — not "native platform look."
  The maintainers follow shadcn/ui + Apple HIG + Fluent design philosophy;
  they'll accept exposing knobs, not changing defaults.
- **No API breaking changes.** Add new builder methods, new optional theme
  tokens, or new style parameters — never change existing signatures or
  defaults.
- **One concern per PR.** Each PR should expose one category of
  customization (e.g., "allow custom checkbox indicator size via theme
  token" or "expose button padding as configurable").
- **Provide concrete benefit.** Show how the change enables theming use
  cases (screenshots of before/after with different themes help).
- **Follow their CONTRIBUTING.md.** AI-generated code must be disclosed
  and human-reviewed. Default cursor for buttons (not pointer). Medium
  sizes as default.

Checklist of likely needed PRs (discover exact gaps during connector work):

- [ ] Audit gpui-component widgets for hardcoded values that should be
      theme tokens (padding, icon sizes, corner radii, spacing)
- [ ] PR: expose per-widget padding/margin as theme-configurable
- [ ] PR: expose checkbox/radio indicator size as theme token
- [ ] PR: expose scrollbar dimensions as theme-configurable
- [ ] PR: expose button min-height and icon spacing as theme tokens
- [ ] Additional PRs as gaps are discovered during connector implementation

## Publishing Prep

- [ ] Publish to crates.io

## Post-1.0 / Deferred

### Change notification
Ship without it. Users can poll `from_system()` or use their toolkit's
appearance observer. Add when there's demand.

- [ ] Linux portal: `SettingChanged` D-Bus signal via ashpd stream
- [ ] Linux KDE: `notify` crate file watching (`watch` feature)
- [ ] macOS: ObjC notification observers
- [ ] Windows: `UISettings.ColorValuesChanged` event

### Mobile readers
- [ ] iOS: `from_ios()` via `objc2-ui-kit`
- [ ] Android: `from_android()` via `jni` + `ndk`, Material You (API 31+)
