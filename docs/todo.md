## Toolkit Connectors

### native-theme-gpui connector

- [ ] Map `WidgetMetrics` → gpui-component per-widget styling

#### Upstream PRs to gpui-component

Where the connector needs customization hooks that gpui-component doesn't
expose, submit PRs to gpui-component upstream. Guidelines for acceptance:

- **Frame as "more theming flexibility"** — not "native platform look."
  The maintainers follow shadcn/ui + Apple HIG + Fluent design philosophy;
  they'll accept exposing knobs, not changing defaults.
- **No API breaking changes.** Add new builder methods, new optional theme
  tokens, or new style parameters — never change existing signatures or
  defaults.
- **One concern per PR.** Each PR should expose one category of
  customization (e.g., "allow custom checkbox indicator size via theme
  token" or "expose button padding as configurable").
- **Provide concrete benefit.** Show how the change enables theming use
  cases (screenshots of before/after with different themes help).
- **Follow their CONTRIBUTING.md.** AI-generated code must be disclosed
  and human-reviewed. Default cursor for buttons (not pointer). Medium
  sizes as default.

Checklist of likely needed PRs (discover exact gaps during connector work):

- [ ] Audit gpui-component widgets for hardcoded values that should be
      theme tokens (padding, icon sizes, corner radii, spacing)
- [ ] PR: expose per-widget padding/margin as theme-configurable
- [ ] PR: expose checkbox/radio indicator size as theme token
- [ ] PR: expose scrollbar dimensions as theme-configurable
- [ ] PR: expose button min-height and icon spacing as theme tokens
- [ ] Additional PRs as gaps are discovered during connector implementation
