# Roadmap: native-theme

## Overview

native-theme delivers a toolkit-agnostic Rust crate for unified OS theme data. The roadmap builds outward from a stable data model core: first the types and serde layer, then bundled presets for immediate usability, then platform readers (Linux KDE/GNOME, Windows) each as independent feature-gated modules, then cross-platform dispatch tying them together, then extended preset coverage (platform + community themes), and finally documentation with toolkit adapter examples. Each phase produces a verifiable, independently useful increment.
